# Le-Lecteur-Online-BookStore-Project
This is the repository for an online bookstore that we have designed for our Web Programming Course Project. We have made use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, some NodeJS and we have also connected this website to a database so that we can gather data from the forms that we have created.
